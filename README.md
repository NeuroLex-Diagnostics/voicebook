This is an assortment of all the scripts associated with [Intro to Voice Computing Book](http://voicebook.neurolex.co). These scripts should give you a jumpstart in learning how to write Python code for voice-related applications.

## Getting started: setting up environment (mac)

*Note that these are the instructions for Mac computers; you may need some custom setup of [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) and/or [SoX](http://sox.sourceforge.net/) if you're using a Windows and/or Linux computer.* 

First, clone the repository and submodules:

    cd ~
    git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voicebook

Now you need to run the setup.py script to make sure you have all the required dependencies for all the chapters of the book. To do this, run:

    cd ~
    cd voicebook
    python3 setup.py

Now you have all the dependencies necessary to follow along with the chapters in the book. You donâ€™t need to worry about any other installations.
