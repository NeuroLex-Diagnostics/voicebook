## Getting started: setting up environment (mac)

First, clone the repository in the terminal application and 

    cd ~
    git clone git@github.com:jim-schwoebel/voicebook.git

Now you need to run the setup.py script to make sure you have all the required dependencies for all the chapters of the book. To do this, run:

    cd ~
    cd voicebook
    python3 setup.py

Now you have all the dependencies necessary to follow along with the chapters in the book. You donâ€™t need to worry about any other installations. Also, the entire book is available in the voicebook folder for you to read :-)
