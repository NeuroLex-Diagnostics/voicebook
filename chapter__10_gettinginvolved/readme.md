## The Innovation Fellows Program  
We created the TRIBE model to work with outstanding individuals to help accomplish our mission to build a universal voice test to refer patients to specialists faster. Fellows come from many different backgrounds - undergraduates, graduate students, faculty members, physicians, engineers, computer scientists, and other professionals. 

Fellows contribute to NeuroLex by pursuing a data science project to model existing datasets or a research-related project to collect more data around an existing or new use case. Research demos are important for us since many of our datasets have a very small number of samples, we're very focused on curating a larger dataset and have it open-sourced to advance this work into the world.

If you're interested, definitely apply to the next TRIBE [here](http://innovate.neurolex.co) by October 27th, 2018. You can read [this FAQ](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1BhGxQyvcO1YZKl-Yic0MDx8IZzqNjw6m) and watch a previous demo day (TRIBE 2) below to get a better feel for the program. If you have any additional questions, please reach out to Jim Schwoebel @ js@neurolex.co.

## Launch a startup 
If you’ve built something cool, there is no better time to start a company. Here are some early-stage accelerator funds that can help get you off the ground.

| Accelerator Fund | Description  | 
| ------- | ------- | 
| [Y-Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/rfs/#voice) | The most well-known accelerator that has funded over 900 startups. In the request for startups YC has stated they are excited about the voice computing space. | 
| [Techstars](https://www.techstars.com/) | Various accelerators across the USA. Have a strong interest in machine learning and voice computing startups. | 
| [Betaworks](https://betaworks.com/voicecamp/) | Betaworks is a great leader in the voice computing space. They were one of the first VCs to explicitly host a voice-based accelerator program called VoiceCamp (NYC, NY). | 
| [Alexa Accelerator](https://www.techstars.com/programs/alexa-program/) | Also, the Amazon Alexa Fund (Accelerator) exists to seed voice-based startups out of Seattle, WA. | 

If you're an individual angel investor and/or accelerator fund looking to make angel-type investments in voice computing, let me know on [GitHub issues](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voicebook/issues) and I can include you on the list above! ^ 

## Teaching voice computing
We don’t have enough teachers of voice computing! You can definitely use this book to teach others about your craft and get them up-to-speed on the technology. I find teaching is the best way to learn something. You always learn something new from others learning as well because they provide a fresh perspective and look on problems you are currently facing.
